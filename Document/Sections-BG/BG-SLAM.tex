\section{SLAM}
Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) is an important research topic in the field of modern robotics. As the name name suggests, SLAM consists of two main components, namely Localization and Mapping. Localization on its own is the problem of estimating the robot's location, while the process of building a model of the environment can be described as Mapping. Therefore, solving the SLAM problem includes a robot moving through an environment and building a map while correctly estimating its own location.

\subsection*{Why SLAM is needed}
No matter if its a car needing to be able to safely navigate urban and dynamic areas, full of pedestrians and other cars, or a robotic vacuum cleaner that has to clean small, indoor areas, being able to sufficiently solve the SLAM problem at hand is a necessary step for the robot to become fully autonomous \cite{Durrant_Whyte_Bailey_2006}.
