% 1. $SLAM gibt $OUTPUT aus, daher haben wir optionen an Algorithmen
One of the many outputs of RTAB-MAP is a dense point cloud. Because of this, we reduce the options of plane detection
algorithms to only those which require a point cloud as input.
In the following we present a selection of plane detection algorithms which we will compare
with respect to the previously defined requirements.

\subsection*{RSPD}

RSPD (Robust Statistics approach for Plane Detection)\cite{Ara√∫jo_Oliveira_2020} does not rely on further input aside from the point cloud.
Its performance was evaluated on \textcolor{red}{their own dataset}. According to the authors report, their method found 90\% of all planes on average while achieving
reasonably low runtimes of avg. 0.0021 seconds per point.
