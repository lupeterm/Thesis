\section{Problem Description}

This work covers the question wether or not it is possible to detect planar objects in real-time on off-the-shelf hardware.
Furthermore, we assume an indoor environment (office, living room etc.). \textcolor{red}{explain why i expect a lot of noise from indoor envs?} Because of this assumption, a high level of precision or a tolerance against noise and/or
clutter is required.

\[Why \space SLAM \Rightarrow realtime \]
