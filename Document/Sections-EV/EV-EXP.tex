\section{Experiments}
We previously compiled a list of algorithms to compare under also previously defined Requirements.
To be able to precisely compare them, we do \$STUFF.
We perform the experiments on \$DATASETS
To visualize results, we integrate RVIZ in our ROS Architecture.
% 1. Basic concept to conduct experiments we use ROS, $SLAM and integrate $PDA
% 2. Datasets (hier?)
% 3. show example of ros node for an arbitrary PDA
% 4. to verify found planes we visualize them using RVIZ
